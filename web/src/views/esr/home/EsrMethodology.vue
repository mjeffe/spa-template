            As specified in Arkansas Act 852 of 2015, information detailing the
            areas of study for each certificate and degree at each
            state-supported institution in Arkansas is also included in this
            2018 report. Students who were still enrolled in higher education
            during 2017 after their graduation were excluded from the full-time
            employment calculations.

            The Arkansas wages data used for this report do not include
            employment outside of Arkansas, federal or military jobs, or any
            employed Arkansans who are not reported to Arkansas unemployment
            insurance.

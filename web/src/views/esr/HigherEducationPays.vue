            When it comes to jobs, one of the first questions that everyone asks is: “How much does it pay?”
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer that question, the Arkansas Department of Workforce
            Services (ADWS) has compared the amount of education to the amount
            of money you can earn in the first year after college.
